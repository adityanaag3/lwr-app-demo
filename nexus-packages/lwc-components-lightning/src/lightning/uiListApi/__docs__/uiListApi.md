The `lightning/uiListApi` (Beta) module provides the `getListUi` wire adapter.
`getListUi` gets list view records and metadata for a list view by:
* List view API name
* List view ID
* API name of supported object

You can also get list view records and metadata for a most recently used list view by object. For this module's specification and examples, see the [Lightning Web Components Developer Guide](docs/component-library/documentation/lwc/lwc.reference_lightning_ui_api_list_ui).

#### LWC Recipes

The [LWC Recipes GitHub repository](https://github.com/trailheadapps/lwc-recipes) contains code examples for Lightning Web Components that you can test in an org.

For a recipe that uses `lightning/uiListApi`, see the `c-wire-list-view` component in the LWC Recipes repo.
